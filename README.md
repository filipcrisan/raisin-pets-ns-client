## about
This is the NativeScript client implementation of the raisin' pets application.

## build & run

The first necessary step is building the application, which is straight-forward, both on iOS and Android. For actually running the application, a proper device should be plugged into your computer, or a simulator can be used alternatively.

If using a simulator, certain features might not work, due to the simulator's limitations.

### iOS

For building, run the following command:

```
ns build ios
```

For starting the application, run the following command:

```
ns run ios
```

### Android

For building, run the following command:

```
ns build android
```

For starting the application, run the following command:

```
ns run android
```
